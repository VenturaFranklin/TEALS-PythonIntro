    "# Lab 4.04 - Shopping List\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to practice using and accessing items from lists of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have a few errands to run and have created a few shopping list to help you remember what to buy. You stored your notes in a nested list, `shopping_cart`. \n",
    "This program will allow the user to ask for a specific item by it's index or update what items are in the cart. The user can request to `view list` to see the items in a specific shopping list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shopping Cart\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shopping_cart = [\n",
    "['tooth paste', 'q-tips', 'milk'],\n",
    "['milk', 'candy', 'apples'],\n",
    "['planner', 'pencils', 'q-tips']\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Inputs\n",
    "* `update`\n",
    "\t* The program asks which shopping list the user wants to update, which position it should update, and the new value to update.\n",
    "* `view item` \n",
    "\t*  The program asks which shopping list the item is on and which position it occupies, then prints the items name.\n",
    "* `view list`\n",
    "\t* The program asks which shopping list the user wants and prints all of the items associated with that shopping list. \t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "###Functions\n",
    "* `update_list`\n",
    "    * Takes in an integer representing the index of the shopping list, an integer representing the index of the item to update, and a string representing the new value for that item. Does not alter the length of the list.\n",
    "* `print_item`\n",
    "    * Takes an int representing the index of the shopping list followed by an int representing the index of the item to print.\n",
    "* `print_list`\n",
    "    * Takes an int representing the index of the shopping list to print.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feel free to add more functions as you see fit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>>What would you like to do? view list\n",
    "Which shopping list would you like to see? 1\n",
    "tooth paste, q-tips, gum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lab you will go through your shopping list program and perform a few different calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function, `all_in_one`, that will put all the shopping lists into a single list using a for loop. \n",
    "2. Create a function, `count_q_tips`, which will go through all items of the list and keep a count of how many times `'q-tips'` occurs. \n",
    "3. In order to make the shopping lists more calcium rich, write a function, `drink_more_milk`, that adds `'milk'` to each of the lists (unless it's already there). \n",
    "4. You can't have milk without cookies. Write a function `if_you_give_a_moose_a_cookie`, that will go through every element of `shopping_cart` and update `'milk'` to be `'milk and cookies'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Bonus! \n",
    "Write a function to reverse the order of the lists and items in `shopping_cart`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list should look like the following when printed: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shopping_cart = [\n",
    "['q-tips', 'pencils', 'planner'],\n",
    "['apples', 'candy', 'milk'],\n",
    "['milk', 'q-tips', 'tooth paste']\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Tip\n",
    "Last item can be gotten by `my_list[-1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Second to last element: `my_list[-2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Third to last element: `my_list[-3]`\n"
   ]
