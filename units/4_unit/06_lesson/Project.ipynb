    "# Project 4: Tic-Tac-Toe\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python, students will create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project has two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Designing the game so that two users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against one another.\n",
    "2. Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe checker which will check the board to see if Xs or Os have won the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tic-tac-toe) is a game in which one player draws X's and another player draws O's inside a set of nine squares and each player tries to be the first to fill a row, column, or diagonal of squares with either X's or O's. We will be writing an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe program. At the end of each turn the computer will check to see if X's have won the game or if the O's have won the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "* The program will prompt the user to enter their name and their opponents name. \n",
    "* Whoever enters their name first will be playing as X's, and the other player will be O's. \n",
    "* The players will take turns inputting the row and column they would like to place their mark. \n",
    "* If that spot is already taken the program will ask for the spot again. \n",
    "* At the end of each player's turn the program will check if that player has won.\n",
    "* At the end of each player's turn the program will print the updated game board.\n",
    "* If there are no more spots open and nobody has won the game, the program will print `Tie game!`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "* Use variables to store the user names for personalized prompts.\n",
    "* Create a game board represented as a list of lists, size 3 by 3. \n",
    "***Note: This is a change from our earlier implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe. Why do you think this might be better?***\n",
    "* Check for a winner horizontally, vertically, and on both diagonals.\n",
    "* Cannot allow a user to overwrite a spot on the board.\n",
    "\n",
