    "1.  **4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem**\n",
    "    *  Introduce students to the [4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem]\n",
    "2.  **Project Overview**\n",
    "    *  Introduce students to the Mad Lib concept by using a short, written out Mad Lib on the whiteboard, poster paper, or projector.\n",
    "    *  Pass out and the project specification and walk students through all the requirements and potential challenges.\n",
    "    *  Emphasize that prompts must ask for the correct noun-verb combinations.\n",
    "    *  Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements.\n",
    "    *  Demo a sample project solution (access protected resources by clicking on \"Additional Curriculum Materials\" on the [TEALS Dashboard](https://www.tealsk12.org/dashboard/)) for students to see how a completed program should function.\n",
    "    * Identify the sub problems of Mad Libs\n",
    "        * Have students list what variables, inputs, and print statements they will need  \n",
    "3.  **Project Work**\n",
    "    *  This project is a summative assessment for the unit. Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.\n",
    "    *  Most students will require roughly 1 hour of total work time to complete the project\n",
    "    *  Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.\n",
    "    *  Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students\n",
    "        *  It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on\n",
    "    * If most students have the ability to work on assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.\n",
    "        *  If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who not able to work at home, such as after school lab hours\n",
    "    *  Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project\n",
    "4. **Wrap Up - Student Demos**\n",
    "    * Celebrate and showcase student work once projects are completed. \n",
    "        *  Have students demonstrate their Mad Libs for the class, with the class choosing what nouns/verbs/etc to use for the story.\n",
