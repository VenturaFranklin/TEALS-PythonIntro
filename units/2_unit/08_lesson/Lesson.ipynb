    "  * Review [4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem]\n",
    "2. **Project Overview/Demo** \n",
    "  * Distribute the project spec to all students and walk them through the goals and requirements of the project. \n",
    "  * Show a demo of a completed project.\n",
    "  * Go over specific design considerations from the project spec: \n",
    "    * Draw out a game board using lists and a variable saving the current floor. Have students call out moves and practice going through a game. (Note using lists of lists ended up being too much info to cover here. If you think the students are ready it would make more sense design wise)\n",
    "    * Introduce the concept of global variables and how they will be useful here.\n",
    "    * Identify the importance of the \"User Pocket\" and how to use a list along with `append` and `remove` for this information.\n",
    "3. **Design**\n",
    "    * Have students stay at their desks and write down what lists they'll need. \n",
    "    * They should break up the project into parts: parsing user input, keeping track of players position, returning what is at the player's position .\n",
    "4. **Debrief/Review**\n",
    "    * During discussion and warp up at the end of class, get a feeling for where students are in the project. \n",
    "    * During the review the next morning cover the topics/areas that students are struggling on and present tips, suggestions, and goals for that day.\n",

    "### Accommodation/Differentiation\n",
    "Make sure to do status checks with all students throughout the project. Identify students that are struggling on the project after the first few days and provide additional scaffolding & support as needed. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For any students that are advancing rapidly through the project, give them extension ideas such as adding a new feature or floor to the game. \n",
    "Advanced students can also be paired as tutors/helpers with struggling students.\n",
