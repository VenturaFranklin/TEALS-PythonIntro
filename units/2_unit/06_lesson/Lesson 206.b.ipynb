    "1. **Do Now**\n",
    "    * Students experiment and learn that if they want to find out if a particular element is in a list, there is a useful tool that can save time.\n",
    "2. **Lesson**\n",
    "  * Go over the list `in` operation. Ask what the return value is (Boolean expression).\n",
    "    * Have students practice using the `in` operation in an if statement. User this time to look over the student responses to the first part of the Do Now - identify the topics they are having problems with.\n",
    "3. **Review**\n",
    "    * Spend time reviewing the topics students are confused about.\n",
    "    * Have students practice using lists and Boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accommodation/Differentiation \n",
    "This lesson may not be necessary, however this is a good opportunity to check for student understanding of lists and associated functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There could also be a unit quiz after the game loop lesson or during the Zork project, and this lesson could be used to review for that quiz.\n",
