    "## Instructor's Notes\n",
    "1. **Do Now** \n",
    "    * Project the Do Now on the board, circulate around the class to check that students are working and understand the instructions. \n",
    "    * Students should quickly realize that they do not have all the tools necessary to complete the task.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Lesson**\n",
    "    * Ask students what they felt like they needed that they had in Snap!\n",
    "    * Explain that in order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. \n",
    "        * **Conditional** statements give us this ability to affect the **flow of control**. \n",
    "            * The simplest form is the `if` statement. The boolean expression after `if` is called the condition. If it is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If not, nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if x > 0: \n",
    "        print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Write out the syntax of the `if` statement on the board. Point out the Boolean expression(condition), the colon, and the indentation. \n",
    "  * Ask students if they recall what else went along with the if statement when they used it in Snap! \n",
    "    * `else` is used when there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed.\n",
    "    * Demonstrate the syntax of `else`\n",
    "  * Describe the `elif` statement\n",
    "    * Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional:\n",
    "        * Demonstrate the syntax of `elif`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lab**\n",
    "    * Students convert the triangle program written in Snap! into Python. \n",
    "    * Students must also write a program that simulates a list index using `if` statements. \n",
    "4. **Debrief**\n",
    "    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accommodation/Differentiation\n",
    "Use the following as an extension activity for students that are moving quickly:\n",
    "* Convert and finish the following SNAP Vending Machine program in Python.\n",
