    "\n",
    "1. **Do Now**\n",
    "    * Students follow instructions to create lists and use the `len` function. \n",
    "2. **Lesson**\n",
    "  * Ask students to recall what a list is, and how lists were used in Snap!\n",
    "    * A **list** is a sequence of values. In a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or **items**.\n",
    "    * In Python, to create a list you must enclose items in square brackets.\n",
    "    * Emphasize that you can have lists of any type (int, float, string, etc). You can even have lists within lists (more on that later...)\n",
    "    * Remind students of lists in Snap! \n",
    "\n",
    "    ![lists in snap](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/3-lists/wordlists.png)\n",
    "  * Ask students what `len` does when they used it in the Do Now. \n",
    "  * Ask students how they tried to print the first item from a list. Was this what they were expecting? \n",
    "    * **index**: a map from the position in the list to the element stored there. \n",
    "    * 0-index: lists are 0 indexed. So the first element in the list is at the 0-index\n",
    "    * Out-of-bounds: what happened when you tried to index into a list that was too long?\n",
    "    * Snap Equivalent: ![snap indexing](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gs5how_many.png)\n",
    "    * Ask students how they would access the last item in a list of unknown length. (Use the length function!) \n",
    "        * Ask students to write on the board how they got the last element of a list. Ask another student to write how they would get the second to last element of the list and so on. \n",
    "    * After accessing any list element you can change it. Take a moment to demonstrate this syntax before starting the lab. \n",
    "3. **Lab**\n",
    "    * Practice accessing and updating items in a list\n",
    "    * Implement program from last lab using lists\n",
    "    * Create a quiz program\n",
    "4. **Debrief**\n",
    "    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accommodation/Differentiation\n",
    "If students are moving quickly, you can introduce the topic of nested lists. Start off with a simple nested list like `['a', 'b', 'c', [1, 2, 3]]`. Ask the students to guess the length. Ask the students to guess how they would access the item '1' from that list! \n",
