    "* Declare 10 prizes (prize0, prize1, prize2 at the top of your file), but store them all in a list.\n",
    "* User picks a number.\n",
    "* Print prize associated with the door user picked. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create a quiz to help you choose which college you should go to (or another topic of your choice. See Example Below)! The program should ask the user a question and list five possible answers. If the student chooses the first answer, add 1 point to `School[0]`. If they choose the second answer add 1 point to `School[1]`, and so on. At the end print out the schools and the scores for each school. \n",
    "* Create a list of 5 options of colleges.\n",
    "* Create a different list of five 0s, representing the user's votes so far.\n",
    "* Create 4 questions. Each question should have five different answers. Each answer corresponds to the specific school option.\n",
    "* At the end print off the 5 different schools and the score the user got for each of those schools. \n",
