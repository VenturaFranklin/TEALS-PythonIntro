    "* Define and identify: **function, arguments, calling, importing, returning**\n",
    "* Call the built-in `randint` function, using arguments\n",
    "* Utilize code other people have written in the Python documentation\n",
    "* Understand the difference between printing and returning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials/Preparation\n",
    "* [Do Now]\n",
    "* [Lab - Magic 8-Ball]\n",
    "* Associated Reading - section 3.1 of Book\n",
    "* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.\n",

    "## Instructor's Notes\n",
    "1. **Do Now**\n",
    "    * Give students 3-4 minutes to follow the instructions on the Do Now page.\n",
    "    * Debrief the answers to the questions on the Do Now by calling on students to respond.\n",
    "2. **Lesson**\n",
    "    * Build Your Own Blocks vs Functions\n",
    " \t    * **Function**:  a named sequence of statements. You can use functions to perform complex calculations, graphical operations, and various other purposes. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “**call**” the function by name. \n",
    "        * A function definition is like a contract: you tell the programmer what elements the function expects (name and type of arguments) and the function will perform its purpose. It is good practice to use a comment to specify the purpose and contract of a function, including the type of value it returns, if it returns a value.\n",
    "            * Name:\n",
    "            * Purpose:\n",
    "            * Inputs:\n",
    "            * Returns:\n",
    "        * Explain that we have already gotten used to **calling** functions like `type()` and `print()`.\n",
    "    * Ask students how they would create a random number generator. \n",
    "        * Sounds hard! Luckily someone has already done that: the random library (essentially a bunch of code written by someone else) which has many associated functions. \n",
    "        * Remind students what they saw in the Do Now - how to get a random integer: randint(0, 10).\n",
    "            * Identify the 0 and 10 in this example as **arguments**, or values passed into the function.\n",
    "  \t\t    * Ask students what the argument is when we use `print` or `type`\n",
    "  \t\t    * `randint` gives back a value that you might want to store - this is called **returning**. If nothing is given back, the return value is `None`.\n",
    "    * Contract\n",
    "        * Functions have a contract: you write down the name, purpose, arguments with their type, and the return type expected.\n",
    "            * Ask students what the contract of `randint` is.\n",
    "                * Name: `randint`\n",
    "                * Purpose: generate a pseudo-random integer N such that a <= N <= b\n",
    "                * Inputs: 2 values of type integer: a and b\n",
    "                * Returns: integer\n",
    "            * Since `randint` is written by someone else there is a place where that contract is written out - **Documentation**. Have students begin the lab, which will instruct them to find the Python documentation for the random library.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. **Lab**\n",
    "    * Students look through `random` library documentation, practice importing different random functions and using them.\n",
    "    * Create a Magic 8-ball program using a list and `randint`. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Debrief**\n",
    "    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accommodation/Differentiation\n",
    "If students are moving quickly, find another library to import from (see **bonus** in the lab) OR allow students to move on to creating their own functions.\n",
