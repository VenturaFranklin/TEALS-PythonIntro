    "1. **Do Now**\n",
    "    * Students should take 5 minutes to follow the instructions on the Do Now in order to create/manipulate a user-defined function.  \n",
    "2. **Lesson**\n",
    "    * Ask students to brainstorm why, in general, a function might be useful in programming.\n",
    "        * **Abstraction**: managing the complexity of a program by removing details and pushing them down to a lower level\n",
    "        * Less repeated code.\n",
    "        * Breaking the problem up into smaller pieces and solving each piece\n",
    "    * Demonstrate to students how you create a function using *def*, calling out the syntax and where arguments would go.\n",
    "        * Ask students how they would call your example function.\n",
    "    * Have students practice making a function that takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the sum. \n",
    "    * Introduce the concept of a function contract using `#`, which adds a comment (non-executed line of code)\n",
    "        * The function contract should \n",
    "            * specify the name\n",
    "            * explain the purpose\n",
    "            * list what arguments it takes in and the types of those arguments\n",
    "            * specify the return type\n",
    "3. **Lab**\n",
    "    * Practice making a function that will take in a name as an argument and output the 'happy birthday song' to that name. \n",
    "    * Create a function that randomly selects 5 cards from a deck of cards (repeating allowed).\n",
    "4. **Debrief**\n",
    "    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions. \n",

    "If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions to improve an old project.\n",
