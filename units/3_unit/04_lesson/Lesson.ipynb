    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "Students will be able to... \n",
    "* Define and identify: **scope, aliasing, stack trace**\n",
    "* Understand that changing a list in a function updates the list outside of the function\n",
    "* Understand that updating variables in a function does not affect the variable outside of the function\n",
    "* Understand global variables\n",
    "* Draw a simple stack trace\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials/Preparation\n",
    "* [Do Now]\n",
    "* [Lab - Aliasing & Scope]\n",
    "* Associated Reading - section 3.4 of Book\n",
    "* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.\n",

    "## Instructor's Notes\n",
    "1. **Do Now**\n",
    "    * Students have a chance to think about what & discuss what concepts they have been most challenged by.\n",
    "    * Next, students practice passing a list as an argument and updating that list within the function. \n",
    "2. **Lesson**\n",
    "    * Discuss what students observed in the Do Now and take time, if needed, to go over questions about concepts that students find challenging. \n",
    "    * Explain the concept of **aliasing**. You can draw on the board a diagram of the variable pointing to a list. Note that when passing the location of a list you are not passing the actual value, so the list can be changed. \n",
    "    * **Scope** of functions\n",
    "        * Explain to students that variable scope is the part of a program where a variable is accessible\n",
    "        * A variable which is defined in the main body of a file is called a global variable. \n",
    "        * Global variables: variables defined outside of a function and used in many different functions. \n",
    "        * To use global variables defined outside the function you must declare the varaible with the phrase `global name_of_variable`.\n",
    "        * Any variable created inside of a function is a local variable.\n",
    "        * Variables in functions include the function parameters, the variables defined in the function and variables declared as global. \n",
    "        * Local variables of functions can't be accessed from outside when the function call has finished.\n",
    "        * Explain global variables are often used for constants.\n",
    "        * NOTE: We use the 'ALL CAPS' convention for global variables.\n",
    "            * Discuss that programming languages frequently have conventions like camelCase for function names, ALL_CAPS for globals, and underscore_separated for variables. It helps make code more readable, but isn't essential to functionality (in most cases)\n",
    "   \t    * Demonstrate how to draw the Stack Diagrams shown in the course book (found in section 3.4) and explain how they show the scope of variables as they related to functions.\n",
    "   \t    * Point out the error messages that will occur if you use a variable out of it's scope.\n",
    "    * Debugging\n",
    "        * Help students follow their program to understand how the code is working\n",
    "        * Explain how the use of print statements throughout your code can let you know where in the program things are not operating as expected.\n",
    "3. **Lab**\n",
    "    * This lab has students running code that gets them thinking about aliasing and scope. They must also create a stack trace for a program to show their understanding of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Debrief**\n",
    "    * Take time to review the concepts covered today: **scope**, **aliasing**, and **stack traces**. \n",
    "    * Call a few students to the board to draw their stack traces from the lab and talk through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accommodation/Differentiation    \n",
    "If students are moving quickly, they can look ahead at the project spec or research the game Oregon Trail for context.\n",
